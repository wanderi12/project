<b>How to Save Water at Home: Method #1<br></b>
The first method of saving water is remarkably straightforward! I'm surprised this didn't cross my mind earlier (I picked up the notion from The Frenchie Gardener).<br>

Here's the ingenious trick: Collect the cold shower water.<br>

Whenever you start the shower, the water starts icy cold. Most folks wait around for it to heat up before stepping in, and in the meantime, perfectly usable water runs down the drain. By <br>gathering this chilly water, you can save a few liters each time. Keep a bowl or bucket on hand as you start the shower.<br>

Isn't this remarkably clever?

The collected water is ideal for watering plants. One shower session provides enough water to gratify five of moderately sized balcony plants.
<br>
Now, picture the amount of water a multi-person household could conserve during their showers…<br>

Intriguing, right? My modest accomplishment (five well-tended plants!) has truly motivated me to think further.<br>

<b>How to Save Water at Home: Method #2<br></b>
I've embarked on a fresh mission: Converting wasted water into nourishment for my entire collection of balcony plants.<br>

It hit me that I should look out for the spots where I'm splashing the most because that's where I could save even more water.<br>

The hub of my water usage is the kitchen, where a significant amount of water often slips down the drain, particularly during fruit and vegetable rinsing. I've redefined this as <br>"beneficial" water, perfect for plant hydration. On the flip side, "less favorable" water encompasses dishwater (emanating from handwashing or pot cleaning) and saline water (resulting <br>from pasta or potato boiling).
<br>
Presenting: a pint-sized pail beside my kitchen sink, ever-prepared for action.<br>

A seamless routine unfolds—placing the container beneath the faucet when I cleanse fruits and veggies or briefly rinse my hands sans soap.
<br>
Once the small container reaches its limit, I transfer its contents to a larger container. This "big league" bucket occupies a permanent spot on my balcony (which couldn't accommodate a <br>rain barrel but certainly embraces the capacious bucket).
<br>
Multiple daily trips from the kitchen to the balcony with buckets of saved water (and back with an empty bucket) grant me a sense of accomplishment.<br>

And the outcome?<br>

<b>Goal achieved!!! (I admit to being a little proud of myself.)<br></b>

As the day winds down, the substantial bucket brims with water—an ample supply to quench the thirst of all my balcony plants, even catering to larger specimens like my pair of petite <br>trees.
<br>
Why focus on how to save water at home in the first place?
I remember an acquaintance once said: "Tap water is so inexpensive, you can use as much as you like." That's accurate. In Europe, tap water is affordable. It's within everyone's reach - <br>and should be. So, conserving water is about more than just monetary savings.<br>

It's about a broader perspective: safeguarding our environment. Water is a minimal and invaluable resource globally, particularly water suitable for consumption. In Germany, tap water is <br>both safe to drink and held to the highest quality standards. Immense resources, including energy, time, and labor costs, are invested to ensure clean water flows from our faucets.<br>

That's why it's always prudent to use tap water as efficiently as possible (especially the type safe for consumption) - not just during heatwaves, but consistently<br>
